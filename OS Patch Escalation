Okay, here's the content formatted for a Confluence page. I've combined the escalation plan and the shared responsibility model into a single page, using typical Confluence-friendly markdown and structure.

You can copy and paste this directly into a Confluence page and the formatting should render correctly.

h1. OS Patching Remediation Management

This document outlines the framework for ensuring timely and compliant OS patching remediation within [Your Organization Name]'s environment. It covers both the process for escalating delays and the shared responsibilities between [Your Organization Name] and our patching vendor, [Vendor Name].

---

h2. OS Patching Remediation Escalation Plan

This plan details the steps to be taken when OS patching remediation timelines are missed. The goal is to ensure prompt communication, appropriate management involvement, and timely resolution to mitigate potential audit findings and security risks.

{panel:title=Key Principles of Escalation}
* **Proactive Monitoring:** Identify potential delays before deadlines are missed.
* **Tiered Escalation:** Clear levels of escalation based on severity and duration.
* **Direct Communication:** Prioritize direct calls/discussions over extensive email chains for initial steps.
* **Concise Information:** Provide only essential details at each stage.
* **Actionable Documentation:** Maintain brief, internal notes for audit and follow-up.
{panel}

{info:title=Internal Documentation Note}
All escalations and their outcomes should be briefly documented in our designated tracking system (e.g., [Link to your internal tracking system/Jira project/Confluence page for tracking]) to maintain an audit trail.

| *2. Level 1* | Missed original deadline.                                                 | * *Team Lead (or Manager):* Immediate direct call/walk-over to vendor's local rep/primary contact. Confirm miss, get exact reason & new timeline. | * Obtain a *firm, immediate remediation timeline* and ensure the missed patch is *confirmed for inclusion in the upcoming week's remediation cycle*.         | * *Team Lead:* Verbal update to own manager (system, reason, new timeline).                 | Concise entry in tracking system (patch, server, missed date, vendor reason, new commitment).     |
| *3. Level 2* | Missed revised timeline OR significant, unacceptable delay.               | * *Your Manager:* Call to vendor's counterpart (Account/Project Manager). Reiterate audit risk, demand resolution plan & firm timeline.  | * Secure a *concrete, expedited resolution plan, ensuring a change ticket is immediately created and the issue is addressed without further delay*.            | * *Your Manager:* Brief verbal update to their Senior Manager (Head of IT Ops/CIO).         | Update tracking system with Level 2 details (names involved, key outcomes).                     |
| *4. Level 3* | Level 2 failed to resolve OR high-risk/significant impact delay.          | * *Your Director/Head of IT:* Call to vendor's regional/global leadership. Express dissatisfaction, demand executive intervention.          | * *Immediate executive-level intervention and commitment* from the vendor to resolve the critical patching issue and mitigate audit risk without further delay. | * *Your Director/Head of IT:* Direct, concise briefing to CIO/Management Committee.         | Update tracking system, noting senior leadership involvement and resolution plan.                 |

h2. Shared Responsibility Model for OS Patching Remediation

This model clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of **[Your Organization Name]** and **[Vendor Name]** to ensure efficient, compliant, and secure OS patching remediation. While [Vendor Name] executes patching activities, [Your Organization Name] retains ultimate accountability for system security and compliance.
