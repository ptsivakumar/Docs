h1. MAS Technology Risk Management (TRM) Framework & Logging Checklist

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) establishes a robust framework for Technology Risk Management (TRM) to guide financial institutions (FIs) operating in Singapore. This framework is comprised of *TRM Guidelines* and legally binding *TRM Notices*.

h2. MAS TRM Guidelines: Principles and Best Practices

The *MAS TRM Guidelines (January 2021)* provide comprehensive guidance, principles, and best practices for FIs to establish sound and robust technology risk governance, oversight, and to maintain IT and cyber resilience. They address contemporary and emerging technology risks, including those associated with cloud computing, APIs, and agile development methodologies. While referred to as "guidelines," MAS strongly expects FIs to adhere to them, with any deviations requiring robust justification. Key areas covered include Technology Risk Governance, IT Project Management, Software Application Management, IT Service Management, IT Resilience, Access Controls, Cyber Resilience, Third-Party Risk Management, and Data Confidentiality.

h2. MAS TRM Notices: Legally Binding Requirements

The *MAS TRM Notices* stipulate mandatory legal requirements that FIs must comply with. These notices are specific to different types of financial institutions. Many older TRM Notices have been replaced or updated under the *Financial Services and Markets Act 2022 (FSMA)*, with new notices (e.g., FSM-N03, FSM-N05, FSM-N11, FSM-N21, FSM-N22, FSM-N20 for Cyber Hygiene) effective around May 2024. Common mandatory requirements include maintaining high reliability and availability of critical IT systems, protecting customer information, promptly notifying MAS of incidents, implementing cyber hygiene practices, and overseeing third-party service providers.

h2. Specific Emphasis on Security Logs

Both the MAS TRM Guidelines and Notices place significant emphasis on security logs as a foundational element for effective technology risk management, incident detection, and forensic analysis. Key expectations include comprehensive logging from all critical IT systems, specific logging of security-relevant events (authentication, privileged access, configuration changes), ensuring log content quality (contextual, structured, no sensitive data), robust log management and integrity (centralization, retention, tamper protection), active monitoring and analysis (alerting, anomaly detection), and seamless integration with incident response processes for discovery, investigation, and MAS notification.

h2. MAS TRM Logging Checklist (with References & Classification)

*Legend:*
* *M (Mandatory Control):* A clear requirement often found in MAS Notices or strongly implied as essential for compliance with the spirit of the Guidelines. Non-compliance could lead to regulatory action.
* *G (Good Practice/Guideline):* A recommended practice from the TRM Guidelines that FIs are strongly encouraged to adopt to enhance their technology risk management posture. Deviations should be justified by a robust risk assessment.

* *TRMN (FSM-NXX):* MAS Technology Risk Management Notices (e.g., FSM-N03, FSM-N05, FSM-N11, FSM-N21). These notices replaced older TRM notices effective May 10, 2024, under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2022 (FSMA).
